	<h3>BARNARD COLLEGE DIGITAL HUMANITIES CENTER</h3>

<br>
<br>

	<p>Over the course of an afternoon of panel presentations and roundtable conversation, participants will engage critically with the digital as praxis, reflecting on the challenges and opportunities presented by the media technologies that ever more intensely reconfigure the social, historical, and geo-political contours of the Caribbean and its diasporas. Presenters will consider the affordances and limitations of the digital with respect to a wide range of disciplines and methodologies. As with every iteration of “The Caribbean Digital,” we look forward to picking up themes addressed in our <a href="#archive">previous conferences</a> – many of which currently feature in the three issues of <a href="http://smallaxe.net/sxarchipelagos/"><em>archipelagos journal</em></a>, our peer-reviewed publishing platform dedicated to Caribbean digital scholarship and scholarship of the Caribbean digital.</p>
