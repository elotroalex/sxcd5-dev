<p>Accomplished scholars of the black Atlantic, <strong><a href="/2020/bios#jessica-marie-johnson">Jessica Marie Johnson</a></strong> (Johns Hopkins University), <strong><a href="/2020/bios#annette-joseph-gabriel">Annette Joseph-Gabriel</a></strong> (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor), and <strong><a href="/2020/bios#roopika-risam">Roopika Risam</a></strong> (Salem State) offer reflections on the ways in which digital technologies illuminate points of convergence among various nodal points within the Americas and the larger African Diaspora. Thinking the Caribbean in transnational and transcolonial relation, each of these scholars has humanized digital praxes so as to tell stories about our profoundly networked Afro-Atlantic world. This panel will be moderated by <strong><a href="/2020/bios#marlene-l-daut">Marlene L. Daut</a></strong>.</p>
