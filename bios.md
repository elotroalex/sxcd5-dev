## Rhonda Cobham-Sander

...is the Emily C. Jordan Folger Professor of
Black Studies and English and Chair of Black Studies. Cobham-Sander
teaches Caribbean and African literature in the Departments of English
and Black Studies. Her most recent courses, “Digital Africas” and
“Panama Silver, Asian Gold,” integrate Digital Humanities approaches
into the study of Caribbean and African literature. Her recent book,*“I
and I”: Epitaphs for the Self in the Work of V.S. Naipaul, Kamau
Brathwaite, and Derek Walcott*, looks at how these three famous
Caribbean writers attempt to consolidate their literary legacies in
their later works. She is focused now on two new projects. The first,
“Amital Queer: Aunts, Aunty Men and other Anansis, explores how
Caribbean writers use the idea of the cross-gendered aunt (“tantie”) of
oral performance to both subvert and support class and gender
boundaries. The second project entitled “Corporeal States: Body, Nation,
Text,” argues that using gendered metaphors to shore up the identity of
the nation state in African literature may have the unintended
consequence of destabilizing our assumptions about what constitutes a
body and what defines a text. -->
