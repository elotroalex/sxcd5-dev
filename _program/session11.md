### An installation of digital video works by five contemporary Caribbean artists
---

<br>

> Digital experimentation among artists in the Caribbean began as an alternate space of becoming as soon as the technology became accessible during the 1990s. For example, pioneering works came the from the live VJ public performances and experiments of Maeksaens Denis moving between the raves of Europe and the streets of Haiti. Across the region and the diaspora, in response to traditional regulated territories, new prospects opened up and out for understanding our space. As artists, it brought us together and in communication with each other and expanded our visual vocabularies and ways of imagining. In this other place, somewhere between the actual and the virtual, it continues to expand.
