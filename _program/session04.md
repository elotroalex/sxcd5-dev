Participants in this closing conversation---**[Vincent Brown]({{site.baseurl}}/bios#vincent-brown)**, **[Laurent Dubois]({{site.baseurl}}/bios#laurent-dubois)**, **[Schuyler Esprit]({{site.baseurl}}/bios#schuyler-esprit)**, and **[Holly Bynoe]({{site.baseurl}}/bios#holly-bynoe)**---discuss what it means to be “finished” with a potentially perpetually available digital project. Having curated and maintained Caribbean digital spaces for a variety of audiences, they each consider questions of the sustainability, ephemerality, evolution, and afterlives---planned and unexpected---of these spaces. This panel will be moderated by **[Kelly Baker Josephs]({{site.baseurl}}/team#kelly-baker-josephs)**.
