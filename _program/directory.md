<br>

In this exercise we will compile a collective list of Caribbean Digital Scholarship resources as a community by leveraging social media and a co-produced spreadsheet. After we have collected the data, a few of us will produce a polished directory online that will allow us to browse, preview and search the bibliography of projects and resources we compile. This exercise will hopefully be the beginning of a tradition we can repeat every other few years that would enrich our collective directory.
