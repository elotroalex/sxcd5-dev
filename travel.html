<h2>Arrival</h2>

	<p>Please make sure before traveling that you are eligible to travel to Trinidad, or whether you will <a href="http://www.immigration.gov.tt/Services/Visas.aspx" target="_blank">require a visa</a> to enter the country. Travelers from the US and UK, for example, do not, as well as their respective affiliates and protectorates. Licensed taxi drivers are available just as you exit the customs area. You can identify them by their uniform (white short-sleeved shirts and black pants). Unless you&#8217;ve made arrangements with your hotel or host, we recommend this option. Be sure you have correct directions to your destination beforehand.</p> 

	<P>The conference will take place at the <a href="https://libraries.sta.uwi.edu/ajl/index.php/about-the-library/about-the-library" target="_blank">Alma Jordan Memorial Library</a>, which is centrally located on the University of the West Indies-St Augustine Campus; you can also download a <a href="http://sta.uwi.edu/resources/documents/sta_map.pdf" target="_blank">campus map</a> or use the UWI St. Augustin <a href="http://uwi.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=d2926d682c3c415ba00cf26e1d8ffec7">interactive web map</a>.</p>

<h2>Accommodations</h2>
	<p>We recommend you book your stay at the <a href="https://www.ihg.com/holidayinnexpress/hotels/us/en/trincity/poshi/hoteldetail">Holiday Inn Express</a>. If you find a better rate for the Holiday Inn or decide not to stay at the hotel, let us know.</p> 

	<p>Besides the Holiday Inn, there is a wide range of hotels available. Many Trinidadians also offer bed-and-breakfast accommodations or rooms in their houses. This is a more affordable option. Prices start at around USD $35 a night. If you would like to arrange for this option, please email us. Note that conference shuttle service to the venue is available only to and from Holiday Inn.</p>

<h2>Food</h2>
	<p>We will plan dinners and lunches once in Trinidad. The campus has a food court, if you want to grab a bite on your own. Prices range from around USD $3-10. The street food scenes around the Queenâ€™s Park Savannah or on Ariapita Avenue are also good options.</p>

<h2>Travel tips</h2>
	<p>Travel in groups. Ask one of the local organizers if you have any questions (where to go, where to eat, for example). The St. Augustine campus is one of the safest places in Trinidad, but if you&#8217;re planning an outing, we  encourage you to consult with one of the organizers. Outings can be very fun, and there is much you can do to enjoy your visit to Trinidad and Tobago.</p>
