<h1>Travel</h1>

<h2>Arrival</h2>

	<p>Please make sure before traveling that you are eligible to travel to Trinidad, or whether you will <a href="http://www.immigration.gov.tt/Services/Visas.aspx" target="_blank">require a visa</a> to enter the country. Travelers from the US and UK, for example, do not, as well as their respective affiliates and protectorates. Licensed taxi drivers are available just as you exit the customs area. You can identify them by their uniform (white short-sleeved shirts and black pants). Unless you&#8217;ve made arrangements with your hotel or host, this is your best, safest option. Be sure you have correct directions to your destination beforehand. We&#8217;ll be at the <a href="https://libraries.sta.uwi.edu/ajl/index.php/about-the-library/about-the-library" target="_blank">Alma Jordan Memorial Library</a>, which is centrally located on the University of the West Indies-St Augustine Campus; you can also download a <a href="http://sta.uwi.edu/resources/documents/sta_map.pdf" target="_blank">campus map</a>.</p>

<h2>Accommodations</h2>
	<p>We recommend you book your stay at the <a href="https://www.ihg.com/holidayinnexpress/hotels/us/en/trincity/poshi/hoteldetail">Holiday Inn Express</a>. Besides the Holiday Inn, there&#8217;s a wide range of hotels available. Many Trinidadians also offer bed-and-breakfast accommodations or rooms in their houses. This is a more affordable option. Prices start at around USD $35 a night. If you would like to arrange for this option, please email us.</p>

<h2>Food</h2>
	<p>We will plan dinners and lunches once in Trinidad. There’s a pretty decent food court on campus, if you want to grab a bite on your own. Prices range from around USD $3-10. We will provide a coffee and tea service during the conference. The street food scenes around the Queen’s Park Savannah or on Ariapita Avenue are also pretty amazing.</p>

<h2>Travel tips</h2>
	<p>Travel in groups. If you should visit Port of Spain (the capital), San Fernando, Chaguanas, or any of the more popular locations on the island, you will meet a range of hucksters and hustlers. Ask one of the local organizers if you have any questions (where to go, where to eat, for example). The St. Augustine campus is one of the safest places in Trinidad, but if you&#8217;re planning an outing, we  encourage you to consult with one of the organizers. Outings can be tons of fun, and there&#8217;s lots you can do in Trinidad and Tobago.</p>
